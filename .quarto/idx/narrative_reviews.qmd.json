Although there is no framework for research questions in narrative reviews, the research question should be specific, clear, and focused on the topic the researchers wish to review. One can consider what is already known about the topic and what could be added or improved through further research.\n\n### **Conducting a Literature Search**\n\nThe next step is to conduct a thorough literature search. Begin by selecting appropriate databases, such as PubMed or Scopus, and identifying key terms related to your research question. Although the search terms are not always known at the outset of a narrative review, researchers should provide readers with comprehensive information on how they developed their search strategy and terms, including a well-founded rationale for the decisions made during the process; this information is frequently presented in appendices.

Moreover, be sure to include both published and unpublished studies, such as conference proceedings or grey literature.\n\n### Screening and Selecting Revelant Studies \n\nSpecifying inclusion and exclusion criteria can be beneficial; however, as a narrative review is not designed to be a comprehensive review of the literature, providing the rationale for the chosen parameters is crucial. With narrative reviews, it is not necessary to include every article on a topic. Nevertheless, researchers should be clear and explicit about the choices they made, how they conducted screening, and which team members were involved. Authors should also consider how they assessed the quality of articles included in the review.\n\n### **Organizing and Analizying the Literature**\n\nOnce you have gathered the relevant studies, the next step is to organize and analyze them. Start by creating an outline of the major themes and ideas present in the literature. Assess each study's methodology, results, and limitations, and explore areas of agreement and disagreement among the findings. Researchers must provide examples that justify their interpretations and demonstrate how their interpretations have been used to inform their conclusions.\n\n## Strengths and Limitations\n\nThis part is according to [@sukhera2022] and [@grant2009].\n\n### Strengths\n\nNarrative reviews provide a quick, flexible yet rigorous approach for knowledge synthesis, which is useful to young many educators and researchers.\n\nThe literature review method seeks to identify what has been accomplished previously, allowing for consolidation, for building on previous work, for summation, for avoiding duplication and for identifying omissions or gaps. One can read them as a general and accurate guide to what is already known about a given topic.
